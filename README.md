### Implementation of Detecting Temporal Logic Predicates on Distributed Computations

This is the implementation of `Detecting Temporal Logic Predicates on Distributed Computations`. 

You can generate basis of offline computation trace by running the command `python main.py`. `main.py` contains the example as described in the paper. You can define you own computation and predicate by changing `main.py`.
